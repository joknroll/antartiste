                <p>I am a professional artist, a painter. I am living in Lille, north of France. 
                    I made medical studies to became a dental surgeon. I also studied sociology and Library and Information Sciences. After my studies I return to Art School.
                    Eight years of psychanalyse made me as an artist.
                    Between 2006 and 2016 I realized 30 exhibitions mostly in a regional area but also nationaly.
                    I discovered encaustic painting in 2008 and in 2015 I created my blog Art & Encaustique that gathered all my researches about encaustic and all the artists that  use this medium worlwide. 
                </p>
                <p>Then in 2021, to raise the bar in my own practice, I attendied the 14th International Encausitc Virtual Conference and finaly in 2022 the 15th International Encaustic Conference in person in Provincetown, Massachussets, USA. My recent works were exhibited during this event.  
                </p>
                <p>My work is oriented around four themes : color, material, mouvement and human.</p>
                <p><b>Color</b> is the center of my art for more than 15 years. It is a permanent research and the way I choose to make a connexion between my art and the world I live in. With the color I engage myself in a world of sensibility and poetic, an esthetic choice that is not a choice of facility but also a fight. </p>
                <p><b>Material</b> is a major preocupation in artist’s work. I worked with different mediums as oil paint, acrylic, photography, wood engraving and now encaustic. Painting is a physical engagement, a fight with material. The more you are physicaly engaged the more your art gives you higher results. Wax can be liquid and solid, a malleable medium, in mouvement. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <p><b>The mouvement</b>. It is the engine of my artist’s work and my life. To be in mouvement. To become a musician, a librarian ? More simply,to be an artist. Life is change and mouvement around us but also in every inner metabolic structures of all living beings. But surrounded by the frenetic mouvement of this world we have to find the right mouvement, our own mouvement that make us what we are to be in harmony with the world we live in. I take part of an international mouvement, the Encaustic Mouvement, to answer to L’Entente du Mouvement, philosophic essay of Gibus de Soultrait, french writer and surfer. Threw this I follow my own path. And human feed that mouvement. </p>
                <p><b>Human.</b> Our humanity creates a constant interaction between all members of the human species, wherever we want it or not. To understand that human species I started my personal research by choosing medical studies when I was 18. After that I also studied sociology. In 2011, after spendind a year of exploring The Void, I met Rotraut, who was Yves Klein’s wife, and later in 2020, thanks to encaustic, I met Philippe Cognée, a french painter working with encaustic. In 2022 I crossed the Atlantic to connect with the International Encaustic Community and met Joanne Mattera, a major artist working with encaustic, who created that community. Art is a wonderful space of meetings to connect with others. The human project of encaustic is a social and cultural project Worldwide.</p>
                <p>My New Serie Incertitudes en Mouvement is a proposition and the most achived form of my art after many years of personal researches. It gives, I hope, some new perspectives in the french encaustic landscape. </p>
